Upper Rack Adjuster Kit - White Wheels, Left and Right Sides Specifications
This authentic Dishwasher Upper Rack Adjuster Kit with white wheels is a kit made up of primarily plastic and metal components, which will require a screwdriver to install. This kit comes with all the necessary parts for a dishwasher rack adjuster.  It fits onto the dishwasher rack and connects it to the track allowing it to slide in and out. If broken then the rack will no longer slide properly, and the part must be replaced. In many cases, our customers have reported the top rack of their dishwasher hanging down or sagging due to the adjuster kit, particularly if the wheels, have broken or failed. If you are having problems in this area, this kit will help get your dishwasher back up and running. Check your model number and user manual to see if this part is right for you. The parts for this kit come as a package and are not generally sold individually.

Great upgrade metal parts a little tricky to install but follow the instructions and pay attention to pain of the old adjuster and you’ll be fine

Works great- but not the same setup as original
The part works great and is sturdy- however, there was no instructions at all for installation and the parts are not the same as the factory manufacture parts. I figured it out but it was very difficult to figure out.

Worked great and more durable that original.
Part is of good quality.  Came with no instructions but there’s a YouTube video with the exact application.  Much easier than I expected. Would recommend

Pretty straightforward to install and was a good replacement
We’re no longer frustrated with the broken rack roller, It must be a common problem. When I searched online for a replacement this was one of the first results,

Part appears to be a much sturdier design. With the help of a video online I installed it in less than 30 minutes.

Upper Rack wheel broke off /Front track stops replaced



The upper rack adjuster kit was replaced exactly as the video showed. I felt it was not very complicated and the new parts look more hefty then the original parts. Front track stops was just a matter of snapping them into place.

t-White-Wheels-Left-and-Right-Sides.htmEven though I purchased the end cap pieces for the roller stops, I was able to reuse the original pieces so these are to be keep for spare if required.This was a very cost effective repair instead of replacing the entire rack assembly.NOTE: The original Wheel bracket was a molded plastic piece, but the replacement is Stainless Steel. This had no impact on the functionality, but did add a small amount of noise during the wash cycle. My belief is this is the water hitting the steel vs. hitting the plastic.

Our renters somehow broke the wheel off the upper rack.



I watched the installation video that came with the parts. I removed both sides of the old track assembly and installed the left and right assembly in about fifteen minutes. I honestly believe my seven year old grandson could have done it for me.

Can you send me instruction and pictures to install the upper rack wheels and brackets to the rack. They are not like the ones that are on it now    thanks
For model number WDT910SAYM1



Hi David, 

Thank you for your question. First you will have to remove your upper dish rack and the old adjust kit. Now, when installing the new kit, count 4 rungs from the back of the basket toward the front. Take your  new metal adjuster and thread the shaft through the fourth rung. You may have to tilt it to get it through. When you straighten the part the wheels portion should be on the outside of the rack and the shaft will  be on the inside of the rack. Take your positioner clips and use them to secure the adjuster to the rack. You will see two front tabs and two back tabs. The back tabs will also need to be tilted into place so that they are on the inside of the rack. The flat part of the positioner clips should be on the outside of the rack. Then you will push the clips down on to the adjuster to clip them into place. Now you will have to install the adjuster body on to the adjuster. Pull your adjuster all the way down. Tilt the adjusted toward the inside of the rack, you will notice that the adjuster body has a channel that will fit the adjuster. Slide those two pieces into place together. You will have 4 notches on your adjuster body that fit perfectly with your rack. Pull on your metal adjuster to lock it into place. Grab your actuator. You want to make sure that the thumb pad of your actuator is facing toward the inside of the rack and is closer to the front of the rack. Pull the adjuster arm up as far as you can, so that the body is a little bit above the top of the rack. The set the actuator inside of the two slots at the top of the body. You may have to tilt the body toward the inside of the rack to fit the actuator into place. Once you have that part in place, push the whole assembly down and press it back up against the side of the rack into place again. Now you will take the adjuster cover and install it on to the body from the outside of the rack. There is a little tab at the top of the cover, you will have to push that into place in the slot at the top of the adjuster body. That just snaps down into place. Then you install your two T15 Torx screws into the cover to hold it into place. This installation is the same for both sides. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.

The right hand side of the upper rack isn’t connected to the metal track anymore and therefore can’t hold any weight on the right side. Is there a better part to fix this.
For model number wdt790slym3



Hello Andrew, thank you for your question. The rack adjuster kit has been redesigned as the original adjuster was not as stable and was causing issues for customers. The adjuster kit would come with all parts for the right and left side of the upper rack and would be the only parts that would fix the issue you're having. I hope this helps!

Hello,
 I only need a roller replacement kit for one side of my dishwasher, not both sides. Is it possible to just buy a kit for one side? (part w10712395)
For model number Wdt780saem1



Hello Sarah, thank you for your question. Unfortunately, the manufacturer only sells the kit that includes parts for both sides. Good luck with your repair!

Rack Track Stop Specifications
The rack track stop on your dishwasher is designed to stop the dish rack at the appropriate place when opening and closing the rack. If your dishwasher is not cleaning your dishes properly, the rack stop may need to be replaced. The replacement part may differ slightly from the broken part, depending on the model. However, the different styles are interchangeable. This product is sold individually and comes in both a white and grey plastic version. Many of our customers found this repair to be very easy and takes less than 30 minutes to complete. Simply snap the old part out and snap the new part into place. You will not require any tools to complete the job. This is an authentic part approved by the manufacturer.

Upper Rack wheel broke off /Front track stops replaced



The upper rack adjuster kit was replaced exactly as the video showed. I felt it was not very complicated and the new parts look more hefty then the original parts. Front track stops was just a matter of snapping them into place.

The dish washer wasn’t cleaning dishes



The circulation pump is a super easy fix and the installation video parts select has on its website is accurate. I felt the most difficult part of the repair was removing the dishwasher from the kitchen counter to make the repairs. After you get the dishwasher out, you pretty much just pop the old pump out with your hands and a flat head 
                            ... Read more
screwdriver. (The supplied video is spot on ) Installing the new pump will require a pinch plier or a hose clamp. I chose a new hose clamp as it is cheaper and I would never use the pinch pliers after this job.

The clips that hold the upper rack continue to come off during the wash cycle and melt.We have replaced a couple times what can we do differently to ensure next ones we order will stay on.
For model number WDT910SAYM0



Hi Bill, Thank you for the question. The Rack Track Stop Clips should just snap into place. If they are falling out I suggest checking the ends of the tracks to see if they are bent and not holding the clips in place. Hope this helps!

The control lock (hold 3 sec) on my dishwasher control panel keeps blinking.  It keeps me from activating any other control on the dishwasher panel. What can I do to remedy this problem?  Your help is greatly appreciated.
For model number WDT750SAHZ0



Hello Mary Ann, Thank you for the question. You may need to reset the lock. Press the "Heated Dry" button, then quickly press the "Normal" button. Press the "Heated Dry" button again, and press the "Normal" button again to enter the diagnostic mode. Close the dishwasher door if it is open, and the diagnostic cycle will run. Check the dishwasher after 30 minutes to make sure the diagnostic cycle is complete, in which case the light should no longer be blinking. We hope this helps.

How would a tray stop affect the dishwasher use?  Can wp8565925 used to replace w10508950?  I had to replace the chopper & instructions showed the first item (looked much easier to remove & replace), the 2nd one was very difficult to remove & in fact one of them broke!   Poor design..
For model number MDB7749SBB3



Hello Carol, thank you for your question. This Rack Track Stop for your dishwasher stops the dish rack at the appropriate place when opening and closing the rack. Rack Track Stop, manufacturer's part number WP8565925, is for the back of the top track. Manufacturer's part number W10508950 has been replaced by WPW10508950 as the Front Track Stop on the top rack for your model dishwasher. I hope this helps!

How do you adjust top to extend all the way.It stops less than one half way
For model number 665.13832k601



Hello Shirley, thank you for your question. You might want to check the wheels on the brackets on either side of the rack to be sure there is no obstructions or the wheels are coming out of the track. You may have a bent track or wheel and bracket assembly. The rack should pull out almost the whole way. You can also adjust the rack by pressing the adjuster thumb button on either side of the rack. I hope this helps!

Lower Dishrack Wheel Specifications
This OEM gray Dishwasher Lower Dishrack Wheel Assembly is a plastic kit that allows the rack to slide in and out of the dishwasher easily. If it breaks or becomes damaged. sliding will feel difficult. This can happen due to normal wear and tear, and the part should be replaced if this occurs. Check your model number and user manual to make sure this part is correct. It attaches directly to the dishrack. To repair, open the dishwasher door and pull out the lower dishrack. Next, push the tab from both sides and it should pop out. To install the new wheel assembly, place it on the rack and make sure the caps overlap the wire from the inside before you clip it in place by pushing the wheel. It measures roughly 3x6 inches.

Easy repair & great service!
Just like the original part.  I replaced all 4 wheel sets in about five minutes.  Now its just like new....very easy.  Fast shipping and great service by PartSelect. I ordered 1 set thinking that would do all 4 sides but I had to order 3 more to finish the job.  PartSelect sent the other 3 sets quickly and didn't charge for shipping even though the mistake was mine.   Thanks!

Plastic pieces had broken on both the top and bottom racks



The parts select site had an excellent breakdown of what I needed to replace. When I got the pieces, however, it wasn't so apparent how to do it. I actually used YouTube video to show the process.The trickiest part was actually uninstalling the broken pieces. I had to work backwards through the YouTube video. The o

ther tricky bit is having a sense of how hard you can push to snap plastic pieces in and out.Also, watch the whole video! I didn't, and I ran out for a tool (a star driver, I think that's what it's called) that was actually in the bag of screws that came with the assembly.It seems like Kitchen Aid realizes they have a problem with plastic fatigue, because they have replaced some of the plastic parts with metal. If you take your time and stay organized this is a very doable repair.

Wheels fell off



These wheel assembly that came on the lower rack of my dishwasher were junk!  They started falling off within 6 months.  I put them back on to the point that the pin in the center of the wheels would no long stay in place, thus the frustrating situation of the wheels falling off often.Assembly was easy peasy!

BELT DRIVE Specifications
This Drive Belt is 89.5" long and comes in black, featuring four ribs on the inside for a better grip. This is a long belt that wraps all the way around the dryer drum, around a tension pulley, and then around the drive motor pulley, allowing all the parts to work together, spinning the drum as the motor rotates. If the drum will not turn when the dryer is turned on the belt is likely broken. It is common for belts to stretch or become brittle over time, which is what leads to the breakage. If broken, it should be replaced; the drum simply cannot spin without this belt. Refer to your model number and user manual to check if this part is right for you. Ensure you use work gloves to protect your hands from sharp internal parts during this repair. Please note: When comparing the length of your old belt to the length of the belt as stated here, remember that a small amount of stretching and contortion may occur with belts over time for a range of different reasons. Unless your belt is drastically different in length, this belt is what you are looking for despite any small inaccuracies. You will need to remove power to your appliance, remove the main panel, and access the motor drive to slip your new belt back into place.

Dryer was making increasingly loud "thumping" sound.



Parts were shipped quickly, packaged correctly, and were in original GM packages - very reassuring.  BTW, your customer service is excellent.Reviewed YouTube videos.Patience is required, take your time, take photos of the wires and also make a written wiring chart.  This was the flaw in my planning.  Reference the schematics f
                            ... Read more
rom PartsSelect to number the controls.  Do NOT use masking tape to identify the wires as they will have all stuck together by the time you go to reinstall them.   Most difficult process was removing and identifying the numerous wires to the back panel.  They have push connectors, but some were very difficult to remove.  The people doing the "how to" videos no doubt had them partially released and that made it look easy. Examine the connectors before removing to identify how they are captured by the connector.  A paper clip "tool" I made enabled me to release some of the capture lugs, but some were so tight, I had to use small needle-nose pliers to open up the lug to release the wire on the connector.   When reinstalling, re-tighten those connectors.Replacing the parts was much easier than the wiring disconnect/reconnect process.  I'm happy to report that replacing the rear bearing and the front 2 green and 2 white shim/bearings immediately and completely solved my problem.  For about $150, I restored my dryer to "like-new" functionality and got a lot of satisfaction from doing it.  The project took about 4 hours, which could have been reduced to 2 hours had I know about the clip release and wiring identification process.  Also, make sure you thoroughly vacuum out your unit while it is disassembled.  Good luck!!!

Excessive Drum Noise While Drying Clothes



The PartSelect company's "how to" repair videos are OUTSTANDING. Thank you! The videos provided a comprehensive overview of what to expect in terms of clothes dryer disassembly, component replacement and reassembly. The videos were invaluable tutorials for prior-to-disassembly work.I ordered all the following parts which I fel
                            ... Read more
t were likely excessively worn--white and green bearing slides (two of each required), rear drum bearing kit, drive belt, and idler pulley wheel--to address the noisiness issue.For your consideration: Since our dryer is 12 years old and would be disassembled anyway, I decided to order a new dryer drum belt and idler pulley, to replace these two constant-use items as preventive maintenance.Two notes.One: When replacing the dryer drum bearing parts, you need a T25 torx bit to loosen and remove the three torx-head screws. But using my T25 torx bit-head-style screwdriver, it was impossible to loosen them. Fortunately, I had a T25 torx bit, which I could mount in a socket wrench, which DID allow me to loosen those three torx-head screws without damage/breakage. WHEW! Recommend you are similarly prepared!Two: If you purchase the "Rear Drum Bearing Kit," it already comes with the the "Drum Bearing Sleeve" and "Retainer O-Ring" components I thought I would also need--no need to purchase separately. I returned those two items, unopened, for a refund.All together, from dryer disassembly to, component replacement, to a thorough vacuuming/cleaning, to reassembly and an operational check, it took about four hours. The dryer is now nearly noiseless again! Success!I consider myself reasonably good with tools and have a fair amount of electrical and mechanical skill. My wife assisted with extra hands a couple times, too, seriously reducing my frustration level. Depending on your abilities, you'll take more time or less time than the four hours it took me. I'm certain I saved at least a couple hundred dollars by doing this maintenance myself.In summary, the PartSelect person taking my order was knowledgeable and professional, I received my parts two days after ordering, the parts worked perfectly, and the company refunded my two, unopened returned parts promptly. Overall, a terrific experience. I highly recommend them to any capable do-it-yourselfer.Thanks, PartSelect!

Dyer made a squealing/screeching noise



I have read other postings which describe most of the procedure very well, so I'm just going to add things that should be considered, which I have not read about here. Removing the drum proved difficult due to the lack of room on the two sides.The vent blower motor bracket is at the front bottom of the dryer, and when the two screws
                            ... Read more
 on either the left or right side are removed, the dryer sides spread more easily and allow the drum to be removed or re-installed more easily. Next, the rear drum bearing I bought has a rubber o-ring which holds it in place. There is a good chance this o-ring will be hard and brittle after years of service, and will crumble when removed, in order to replace the bearing. I had to run to the local hardware store to get a new o-ring, and could only find one that did was not rated for high heat usage. I presumed once the drum is re-installed that the bearing can't dislodge even with a missing o-ring. I think it just holds the bearing in place while removing and re-installing the drum, but I cannot be certain about this.So if you plan to replace the rear drum bearing, make sure to also order the o-ring that holds it in place. It is doubtful you can re-use the old one depending on the age of your dryer.Replacing the old white belt tensioning pulley requires the removal and re-installation of a "nut" that has no threads. It is forced on and off and not simple to re-install. The removal was easy simply by using a wrench to "unscrew" it counterclockwise. But re-installing it is another matter. It requires force to get it back onto the shaft. I saw a tip to use a 7/16" socket placed over the nut and hit with a hammer while bracing the bracket from the other side. I did this by used a smaller tool, linesman's pliers, which provided the force needed. Install it about 1/4" past the end of the bracket shaft. Careful, that nut has sharp edges and I ended up bleeding from that process. Three hands would help: one to brace the bracket, one to hold the nut and socket in place, and one to hammer. So good luck with that. Probably there is a smarter way to do this.If you replace the old white plastic belt tensioning pulley with a new yellow one, it is not simple to understand how to re-install the belt properly. The videos do not do the trick adequately. I did find one on youtube where they removed the dryer side in order to show the belt installation and I had an "aha moment". Since you cannot see the belt, the pulleys, the motor, or anything else during installation, it is not a simple thing to do. Here are my tips: Before re-installing the drum, move the belt tensioning pulley bracket to the right (when facing the dryer front) and you will see a little spot where the bracket will stay to the right when engaged in this spot. Engage the bracket and then proceed to re-install the drum. That way, when you reach under the drum to set the belt properly on the pulleys, you won't have to engage the tensioning bracket without being able to see. Once the belt is in place, carefully remove the bracket from the right holding spot and allow it to move back to the left operating position. I used two hands and don't think I could have done it with one. When the belts are new, they can be naturally twisted and you have to be careful to install the belt with no twist. I had to do it twice to get it right. If someone can take up the top belt slack for you, it's easy to feel the belt underneath the drum and get any twists out.Next, i had a hard time inserting the drum back into the dryer and finding the hole where the bearing inserts. The problem is, if you are not careful, it's easy to move, bend, or break the heater wires which surround the hole you need to locate blindly and slip the drum bearing into. I did bend those wires, but luckily not break them.  In hindsight, applying some masking tape to the rear inside panel of the dryer right at the top, left and right of the drum BEFORE removing the drum would have made it much easier estimating the proper drum height while maneuvering the bearing into the rear hole. Then remove the masking tape when done. I ordered a new top plastic front bearing that supports the drum in the front. Good thing I did because mine was split about 5" where one set of the green and white sliders install. I had one white "plastic" insert visible. The other one plus the two green bearings were totally missing. No wonder it was squealing.Finally, the hardest part for me was re-installing the top of the dryer! Take a good look before removing it so you can see exactly how the top fits to the dryer and how the parts need to be lined up first. Thanks to PartSelect.com! Every part was correct and the installation videos gave me so much help. Also, parts arrived in two days, which surprised me. I will be ordering all parts here.

Squeaking



Replace the front and rear bearings. When I have to do it again I will only order (3106), (313), 2x (316) green, 2x (316) white, and drive belt. Taking it apart and putting it back together was easy. Unplug the unit. Take out the 2 philips screws that hold on the top. Lift the top from the front to clear the locking tabs in the back and t
                            ... Read more
ake it off. Take out the 2 5/16 screws that hold on the front. Tilt the front (door) forward and rest the drum on the dryer sides, you'll see it. Disconnect the wiring harness for the light and door switch, 2 wires. Lift the front off the bottom retaining clips and place aside. Have someone hold up the drum. Reach under and unhook the drive belt. Pull out the drum assembly. Take off the rear bearing, 3 screws. Clean out the heating element area in the back of the dryer while you have a chance. Replace the bearing assembly. I bought the entire bearing assembly but I could have gotten away with just the sleeve ( 3106), but I didn't know that at the time. Take off and replace the drive belt. Lock the tension arm for the drive belt into the compressed position shelf holder by the motor, push the arm down, you'll see it. Replace the drum and have someone hold it up while you rehook the drive belt and release the tension arm. Now, I would suggest replacing the entire front bearing. If the slides have been bad for a while, the plastic bearing (housing) is probably worn out and cracked. I had to order a front bearing assembly because the new slides wouldn't work with the worn out assembly, no big deal, it came quick. Unscrew the light bulb. Slowly pull the assembly away from the top of the front metal panel, slowly, and pay attention to where everything lines up. Replace the new front bearing and put the new slides on the little plastic tabs, be careful so you don't snap them off. Green on top, white on the sides. Replace the lightbulb. Set the front panel into place on the tabs at the bottom of the dryer. Rehook the door wires (2), and have someone hold up the drum while you slide the front bearing into the drum. Holding the front panel in place, turn the drum by hand and check for binding, things that don't sound or look right. Replace the 2 nuts to hold on the front. Plug it in, keep your hands back, turn it on, look, listen, everything fine. Open door, unplug, replace the top and the 2 screws that hold it on. Plug in, turn it on and check for any noise, you shouldn't hear any. If you do, you didn't do something right or maybe your drive pulleys are bad. A good dad and son job; especially getting on the ground and reaching under to deal with the drive belt. Watch out for sharp edges on the sheet metal and be slow and careful with the front plastic bearing so it doesn't snap. Your now good for 5 more years. A 2 on the difficulty scale, just take it slow and have an extra set of hands.

How do you if it is the belt? This just stop after turning it on.
Does it need two belts?
For model number GTDP280ED0WW



Hello Jerri, Thank you for your inquiry. Check the belt for any excessive wear and tear and to see if it came off the pulley. The model number that you have provided only uses one belt. The other causes of this issue could be a faulty drive motor, a faulty belt interlock switch, or a faulty door switch. You can test the parts with a multimeter. If you are unfamiliar with how a multimeter functions, we have videos available to assist you. Good luck with your repair.

Dishwasher Upper Rack Adjuster Specifications
This OEM Dishwasher Upper Rack Adjuster is a grayish-black, plastic part which will require a screwdriver to install.  It fits onto the dishwasher rack and connects it to the track allowing it to slide in and out. If broken then the rack will no longer slide properly, and the part must be replaced. The installation has been rated as "easy" by customers. Before beginning any repair, you should unplug the dishwasher and wear gloves to protect your hands. Check your model number and user manual to see if this part is right for you! Your dishwasher should have a left and right upper rack adjuster, and both are the same part. These parts are sold individually, so if you are looking to replace both, you will need to order two parts.

A small plastic knob, that holds the top rack of the dishwasher to the slide rail, broke.



My husband called Part Select and described the problem. After we sent a couple of photos to the technician, she determined the part that we needed...a top rack assembly unit...and it arrived within a few days.I watched the video that Part Select provided and it made the job so much easier than if the new part had been sent with a b

ooklet of diagrams and written instructions. The video showed exactly how to dismantle the old part and then install the new part. It was also helpful to compare the part I was working with to the same part on the other side of the rack so that I knew for sure that I had it positioned correctly.The part and shipping cost about $70.  It would have cost more than 3 times as much if I had to call a repairman.

Remove entire top rack and place on a large flat work surface. A small screwdriver is needed to release several plastic clips holding the upper drawer slider brackets and manifold in place.

plastic parts degraded and failed



I pulled the rack and removed failed parts, then reassembled.  I would note that the videos are helpful as dishwasher racks can be a bit of a puzzle.Why manufacturers use so much plastic in a heated environment is beyond me.  The heat cycle degrades the plastic to failure - poor design!

Attachments from tray to upper rack adjuster broken



Upper tray removed and each rack adjuster removed and replaced  one after the other.  Only tool was screwdriver.  Only knowledge was from the online videos.  Only took 30 minutes or so.  The repair could have been done more quickly if I wasn't fearful that the smaller plastic parts would break when pulled or pried away from the rack adjus

ter.  The only mistake was not making sure the adjuster tabs were fully engaged in back and clicked in the front attachment.

I watched online repair video for replacing the part.  3 different clips held the part in place.  Video showed how to properly remove each clip & also how to put them back on once part is replaced.  Video was immensely helpful because I was afraid I break something else trying o remove them!  I ordered & replaced the part by myself withou

Upper Rack Wouldn't Close



Hardest part was figuring out how to release and remove upper rack as mine did not match the instructions. After that is was tricky but not overly difficult. The instructions on-line did not make sense, but it all was fairly intuitive process. Take some before pictures, lol. Dishwaswasher works great.

The Adjuster tabs broke on both sides



Two of the four small nylon/plastic tabs on the adjusters that support the top rack on the rack slides, broke off (one on each side). Before the new parts arrived, I printed the limited (but definitely helpful) instructions that were available and familiarized myself with the adjuster assemblies. As practice, I too

k one adjuster assembly apart making notes of any "gotchas." The main gotcha I found is that the nylon/plastic parts are easy to break (obviously) as prying is involved during removal and replacement. It took me about 20 to 25 minutes to take one side apart and about 10 minutes to put it back together again. When the new parts arrived, I was able to do the first side in about 10 minutes (removal and replacement), and the second side in about 5 minutes, all because I had printed the instructions, familiarized myself, and practiced. I hope this helps.

Part #4 seems to fit the bill for my problem. Are the the knobs that rest in the u-channels part of this. Problem: One of the plastic knobs broke off the upper rack support (part is entregal). The knob will ride in a metal channel that is part of the slide.

Hi Randy, Thank you for the question. Yes, the Rack Adjuster comes with the knob that ride in the metal channel. Hope this helps!

How do you remove the broken part installed a new one? Part ps11756150
For model number Model kude60hxss1



Hi Val,
Thank you for your inquiry.  Before beginning any repair please unplug the dishwasher and wear gloves to protect your hands. Release the track stops from the upper dishrack rails and pull the upper rack from the dishwasher and place it upside down on a work surface.  Raise the wheels to the maximum height.  Release the top of the long rear clip from the dishrack tine and push the clip down to the release point and remove it.  Press the tab down on the front clip move the clip up to pull it off. Release the locking tabs  on the clip in the middle of the height adjuster and remove the clip. Using a slot screw driver pry the housing cover down and out to release the upper tabs on each side.  Pry the bottom of the housing cover out of the 2 lower locking tabs.  Pull the housing cover off the rack.  Remove the adjuster housing and wheel assembly and repeat the procedure on the other side.  Slide the vertical portion on the new wheel assembly between the fourth set of vertical tines from the back of the dishrack and rotate the wheel assembly so that it lays flat against the side.  Insert a positioner clip above the rear wheel and snap the tab into the slot.  Install a positioner clip on the front wheel.  Position the adjuster body over the vertical portion of the wheel assembly and push in into the slots. Locking tabs at the bottom of the adjuster body engage the the wheel assembly once it is fully inserted the tabs.  Insert the actuator lever into the adjuster body with the thumb pad facing the front of the rack.  Two half circle cut outs on the adjuster body hold the actuator in place.  Push the adjuster body down and install the adjuster cover.  Install the adjuster cover mounting screws.  Repeat this process on the other side of the rack.  Push the upper dishrack onto its tracks.  Close the track stops on the rails and the repair is done. I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!

Are there video installation instructions for replacing the adjuster part w10546503
For model number KUDE60SXSS3



Hello Mark, Thank you for your inquiry. At this time, we do not have a video for this exact part number but I have found instructions for you. Use a small flat head screwdriver to depress the retaining tabs securing the rack adjustors to the tracks. Fully remove the upper rack. Using the flat blade screwdriver, release the tabs to detach the adjuster housing cover and remove the housing. Next detach the front and rear adjuster support straps from the tines and remove them from the rack adjuster. Note the orientation of the rack adjuster, then pry off the stop clip to detach the old adjuster. Install the new adjuster by aligning it on the rack and snap the stop clip into place to secure. Next replace the front and rear support straps. Position the adjuster housing by aligning the locking lever in the adjuster slot then snap the cover on to secure. Then put the upper rack back into place.  Hope this helps!

The part that i'm  finding on line for a upper rack adjustment mechanism  does not look the same as the one on my dish washer and we could not locate the model number on the dishwasher where would we locate that on the unit
For model number KDFE104DSS



Hello Violet, Thank you for your inquiry. You would locate your model number on the left edge of the dishwasher's door, on the upper left hand corner of the unit's frame, on the top of the door jamb-to the left, right, or in the center, on the door itself, to the left, right or in the center, or on the underside of the control panel. Hope this helps!

I used the adjuster to lower the right side of top rack. Now the door will not close. I can't turn the dishwasher on.
For model number KDFE104DWH1



Hello Rochelle, Thank you for the question. I suggest putting the rack back to the normal setting in height to see if the door will close. If the door closes you may need to replace the adjuster. It might be causing the rack to come forward and not allow the door to close properly. Hope this helps!

I have a Kenmore dishwasher. The little plastic piece that sits inside of the roller has broken off and the rack is now sagging on one side. It looks like this adjuster piece is what i need to replace it but, it does not have Kenmore in the list compatible brands. Will this piece work for my dishwasher? Thank you so much and i look forward to your time!In him,

For model number 665.13543N412



Hello Havilah, thank you for your question. The upper rack roller is part of the T shaped adjuster that attaches to the rack itself. The new rack adjuster kit provided by the manufacturer provides all the replacement parts for the right and left sides of that rack. The part number PartSelect Number PS10065979 will be the adjuster kit you need to order. I hope this helps!

Lower Spray Arm Specifications
The Lower Spray Arm is used in your dishwasher to spray water and clean your dishes. If broken there will be visible damage or your dishes may no longer be cleaned properly. If your spray arm is broken (due to general wear or high heat), it should be replaced. Your lower spray arm will be located at the bottom of your dishwasher tub. Check your user manual and model number to ensure this model is right for you. This version is plastic and metal and comes in gray/blue. We recommend you wear work gloves to keep your hands safe when installing and disconnect power to the appliance. You will also want to make sure that you turn off the water supply to your dishwasher. From here, you will want to open the dishwasher, pull out the lower rack and set it aside. Remove the lower wash arm. On each side of the bottom of the spray arm, there are small locking tabs that can be pushed aside using a flathead screwdriver. Once released, the spray arm can easily be pulled off the dishwasher. Put the new lower wash arm in place and push it down to lock it in. Ensure it is spinning freely and does not hit the heating element. Return the lower dish rack into place and then close the dishwasher door.

n to remove the filter basket differed from the manual. Visually line up the notches and do not twist too far when locking or you WILL break the retainer tabs.Simply center the lower spray arm over the support and press down until it locks into place.

Edge metal broke away from the melted tabs



The original lower spray arm had one end break loose the metal retainer end. I used a temporary small hose clamp to fix as I waited for the new lower arm to arrive.The design is very easy.... pull up on the OLD and then just push DOWN on the new arm into the bottom.

The lower dishwasher arm was a replacement for the previous one.



I removed the bottom drawer and glass trap in order to remove the old melted down washer arm. Once those parts were removed I was able to easily secure the new replacement be ensuring that it was turned enough and fit down securely (side note, if you don't hear the arm click or snap into place, it isn't secure). The part works just fine,

Based on our research, here are the steps to replace the part: 1) Ensure your unit is unplugged or the circuit breakers are off before beginning any repair. 2) Turn off the dishwashers water supply underneath the sink. 3) Open up the dishwasher door. 4) Pull the lower rack out and set it aside. 5) Reach in to remove the lower wash arm (On each side on the bottom of the Spray Arm, there are small locking tabs that can be pushed aside using a flathead screw driver to release it from the unit). 6) Once locking tabs have been released, you can pull it off the dishwasher. 7) Put the new lower wash arm in (simply set it down onto its support and push it down to lock it in place). 8) Ensure it is spinning freely and does not hit the heating element. 9) Put the lower dish rack back in. 10) Close the dishwasher door and you are done. We hope this helps! Best Regards.

Does the bottom arm have to be replaced if it's wobbly and keeps hitting the bottom rack? I took the rack out and it cleans fine so i know it's the bottom arm. I do not see a model number on the part and i'm not sure what number to put otherwise from the stickers inside.
For model number I'm not sure how to find it.



Hi Abby,
Thank you for your question.  If the lower spray arm is loose and you are unable to tighten it, then it should be replaced.  If you could resubmit your question, with the model number from your dishwasher, we would be happy to help you with this.  Here is a link from our website that you may reference on where to locate the model number on your dishwasher, https://www.partselect.com/Find-Your-Dishwasher-Model-Number.aspx. If you have any questions, please let us know.

Easy repair, but too expensive
The part fit my machine and was super easy to install.  I just wish the manufacturer of my dishwasher (Whirlpool) didn't make the lower rack with plastic wheels that fall off and then melt in the dishwasher.  Because then you end up paying what I consider way too much for a very small plastic wheel.  I am grateful that PartSelect had the replacement wheels, however.

Easy repair- so glad I found these
4 of the wheels on our GECafe dishwasher melted in the heat of regular cycles (manufacturers defect anyone?) These were easy to put on and solved the problem for the short term. In the long term I will stay away from GE Cafe.

I bought this dishwasher new, and from the get-go, the wheels on the lower rack kept coming off. You sent me replacement parts, but they allowed the wheels to come off. Looking at the drawings it looks like you redesigned the covers and wheel assembly, but you show two different designs.  Which one works with the unit?  This should have been a warranty item. I am not happy with this Dishwasher due to this issue.I have fought it for three years now.
For model number PST715SYN2FS



Hello Ed, thank you for the question. According to our research, both parts are the same. You may need to get a rack carrier kit, part number PS16219735. We hope this helps!

My bottom rack on this dishwasher rolls in & out very poorly whenever we have about 7 Plus plates loaded. This should not be the case as we do regret purchasing this unit a little over a year ago! Any suggestions as we are totally frustrated!!!!!!!
For model number PDT715SYN4FS



Hi David, thank you for your inquiry. The most common cause is either hard water mineral build-up or a build-up of detergent residue. If this is not the issue, you will need to replace the lower rack roller, part number PS16217024. Good luck with this repair!

Refrigerator Water Filter Specifications
This NSF-certified water filter helps to improve the taste, quality, and health of your water by removing a number of contaminants including mercury, lead, and trace pharmaceuticals. The filter should be replaced every six month or after 300 gallons of water have been filtered. If you are unsure if your filter is due for replacement, another indicator is if the water flow from the dispenser has slowed down considerably. Replacing this part is a simple task that does not require any tools or shutting off the water or power supply to your fridge. Once the new filter has been installed, be sure to run at least two gallons of water through before consuming.

Difficulty reaching Customer Service
It took approximately 5-6 attempts to reach you concerning my expired card. No qay to even leave a message. As a result, my automatic subscription ended. I finally reached someone. While I was not happy with the time it took to resolve, I was thankful for getting our filter quickly

Refrigerator water filter replacement.



I followed the directions included with the water filter and it was simple.  The only problem I had was not being strong enough to easily remove the old filter.  I did accomplish that after a few tries and the rest is history.

Replace water filter in icemaker



This was the first time I took out the old filter on my new refrigerator and added the new one. It was a little hard getting the old one out because I was afraid to pull on it but it did come out ok and was easy to put the new one in.

How do you open the refrigerator compartment that houses the water filter? Do you push, pull, or twist the tab at the front end of the compartment. I do not wish to break anything. Once i'm in, i know how to insert the filter (rpwfe),
For model number PWE23KSKBSS



Hi Paul,
Thank you for your question.  There is no need to turn the water supply off to the refrigerator before replacing your filter.  To locate the filter look into the upper left corner of the refrigerator.  When you have located the filter, place a towel on the shelf just under where the filter is in case any water spills out.  Open the door and swing the filter to the right until it stops.  The filter will not release until it is in this position and simply pull the old cartridge out without twisting it.  Align the top of the new filter in the holder with the word front facing outward.  Firmly push the filter in until it engages to insure it is properly seated.  Again being careful not to twist the filter.  Swing filter back into place and close the filter door.  If your filter does not swing into place, make sure that it has been aligned and engaged properly.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!

Hi...i followed the steps to change the filter, reset it and now is not dispensing water...is this something i'm doing wrong?
For model number PS10063209



Hello Azucena, Thank you for your inquiry. I would try taking the filter out and make sure the lines are clean. I have included the installation steps as well. If your fridge still is not dispensing water I would check your water inlet valve and the line that runs from it to the filter. Hope this helps! 

Before removing the old filter, place a cloth beneath the filter to catch the few drops of water that may fall when the filter is removed. Grasp the filter and turn it to the left until it stops, while gently pulling downward from the filter head. Keep the filter level to minimize water spillage. (If the filter doesn't come loose easily, air may be trapped inside. To relieve any pressure, push in on the water dispenser; the filter should drop right out.) Remove and discard the plastic cap from the new filter. Fill the top of the replacement filter with water from the tap. Place the filter inside the cartridge holder by aligning the arrow on your filter with the cartridge holder. Push the filter gently upward to engage the top of the cartridge in the filter head. Slowly turn the filter to the right until the filter cartridge stops turning. As you turn the cartridge, it will automatically rise into position. After the filter has been replaced, trapped air must be purged out of the system. Select Water on the dispenser selector and press the pad until water begins to flow. The first few ounces of water may sputter due to air in the replacement filter. This is normal. Continue to dispense approximately 1-2 gallons of water to make sure all air is purged from the system.

After changing the filter, how much “oz” of water to properly purge the water ?



Hello Maryln, Thank you for your question. You should be flushing 3-5 gallons of water through the filter before drinking. Have a great day!

How do I remove and replace the water filter?
For model number Gfe28gynfs



Hello Bonnie, Thank you for the question. The installation and removal instructions vary slightly. Grey Model: Pull the bottom of the old cartridge allowing it to swing outward. Pull to free the cartridge from the holder without twisting it. To install the new filter, center it with the holder, making sure the word "FRONT" is facing forward and centered. Swing the filter inwards until it is positioned. Black Model: Pull on the bottom of the old cartridge to unlock it from the clips. Swing it outward until you hear a clicking sound. Now twist the cartridge one-quarter of a turn counter-clockwise. Pull it out to remove. To install the new filter, match the filter cartridge with the holder, making sure the word "FRONT" is facing the top of the appliance. Push the filter toward the back of the appliance until it is secured. Twist it clockwise one-quarter of a turn so the word "FRONT" is facing outward. Swing filter inward until it is secured. We hope this helps!

LOWER DISHRACK WHEEL ASSEMBLY Specifications
This gray plastic lower dishrack roller is a part for your dishwasher. It attaches to the bottom of the lower dishrack, allowing it to move in and out smoothly. If the lower dishrack stops moving in and out easily or preventing you from being able to shut the dishwasher door, inspect the dishrack roller for damage. The assembly includes 2 rollers and the bracket that attaches to the dishrack (parts are not sold separately). This assembly is sold individually, so you will need 4 assemblies to replace them all in your appliance. For this easy repair, start by removing the lower dishrack from the appliance and set it on the counter. Use a screwdriver to pry off the old roller assembly from the lower tabs. Align the new part on the dishrack by snapping it in place.

Works Better Than The Previous Part
I purchased rack wheels previously that were much less expensive but didn’t work well at all. Having grown tired of my wife’s expletives, I decided to pay the extra money for this part and it was worth it.

For a person who knows next to nothing about repair, this was a super easy fix!
First, it should be noted that my repair knowledge is/was minimal prior to ordering these wheels. 
Now, a piece of advice from a novice: Take the extra few seconds to plug your model number in at the start to avoid ordering the wrong items and shipping things back. Yup ... did that because "Of course I know which part I needed" ...  I didn't. 
Thankfully the customer service people are phenomenal and helped fix my confusion, aka teach me to read the suggestion of putting in my model number before ordering. 
As far as ordering and replacement goes, a suggestion from me. If your wheel(s) wore out naturally and you are thinking of ordering 1 of these ... DON'T. Save yourself the shipping costs and order 4 of these from the get-go. Disregard if it isn't general wear that caused your wheel to fail. 
Best practice in removal of the old wheel (to prevent you from injuring your hand ... like me ....) use a flathead screwdriver or other punch type tool and a hammer or mallet to break off the 2 locking buttons holding the wheel in place. Attempting to pry them back, while pushing the wheel casing out was a bit of a failure on my part. 
When putting the new wheels in, it was as simple as just snapping them in place and done. The wheels work wonderfully!

All wheels on lower dish rack wheel assembly were broken making the dish rack very difficult to push into dishwasher and remove it.



All four original wheel assembly's were difficult to pop out so used pliers and cutter to brake original part and remove it. Nothing on the original wheel assembly was needed for the repair so braking them off was ok. The new wheel assembly parts, with two wheels on each (4 total), two wheel assembly's on each side of the rack, were easy

to install- no tools needed. Each wheel assembly just popped right into place.

all rollers fell off. lower rack was hard to move when full



Purchase 4 roller wheel assemblies and installed them with only a screw driver to open the tangs.  quick and easy and rack rolls smoothly inside the dishwasher.  Rather expensive $58 per roller assembly and hopefully these last the lifetime of the dishwasher.

replaced wheel assemblies on lower dishwasher rack



After finally getting the older wheels off, it was literally a snap putting the new wheel assemblies on.  I still don't know the best way to get the old ones off, to be honest, but putting the new ones on was really easy.

I only need the pin for the wheel assembly, one wheel fell off and i can't find the pin.  Do they sell the wheel and pin separately?  It seems rather costly for the entire assembly.
For model number KDFE104DWH1



Hi Lois, thank you for your question. Unfortunately no. The axle is not sold without the roller. We apologize that our prices are not as low as you expected. We base our prices on what we are charged by the manufacturer for the parts. We try to keep our prices as low as possible, but do also have to keep them at a level to help cover our costs. We hope this helps to explain the reasoning behind the prices! Good luck with your repair.

Do the wheels stay on? The ones i have now keep popping out.
For model number KDFE104DBL1



Hello Betty,
Thank you for your question. They are supposed to stay on the roller plate yes. If the wheels keep popping off, you would need to replace the entire roller since the wheels are not available separately. Hope this helps!

How does this part attach to dishwasher?
For model number W10195417 whirlpool wheels directions



Hello Ruth, Thank you for your inquiry. Align the adjustable tines with the middle slot in the roller assembly, then  it should just snap into place on the rack. Although we do not have a repair video for this exact part number, I have included a link for a similar model to assist you. Hope this helps!

Refrigerator Ice and Water Filter Specifications
This OEM ice and water filter fits side-by-side and bottom-freezer GE models. The most common reason you would need to change this part is if you have never updated your model and it is no longer filtering your water. This also may lead to your refrigerator not dispensing water or ice properly. Manufacturers recommend you change your filter every six months to ensure it properly filters impurities. Depending on the model, a red light might also indicate that the filter is due for a replacement. Note: As per the manufacturer, this is an updated water filter. If you have never installed the updated part or your old model was made by Culligan, you may need the adapter to install the filter. See related parts. This filter is located inside the refrigerators upper right corner. It is common for water to drip from the dispenser when being changed so place a cloth underneath before you begin this repair. To remove the filter, turn it to the left until it releases without pulling down. Fill the new filter with tap water to prepare it. Position the new filter into the holder taking note of the arrows. The arrow on the front should be facing out. Gently push up on the filter and turn it to the right to secure it. Do not over-tighten. To release air in the system run 1-1/2 gallons of water through it. If your model has a reset button, press and hold this for a few seconds to reset it.

I found that I didn't need this
The part was fine, but the apartment I live in changes the filters, so I really didn't need it. I will keep it just in case they do not change it when I think it is time.

Easy repair
We noticed that our ice in our ice maker was getting smaller and smaller. When I looked up why it said the filter needed changing. I started researching replacement filters and was very surprised at the high cost. Then I came across partselect.com and was pleasantly surprised at the price. We used a YouTube video to replace the filter and I am happy to say it went well, no leaks and our ice is back to its normal size!

The Frame Cover I ordered had broken. 3rd time replacing it. Bad Quality



There is a shelf that goes on top of the frame cover. That was not broken. Replacement was not necessary. The shelf does not fit properly in the new frame. Your advice was to buy a new shelf at a cost. Would have been good to tell consumer that the product doesn't fit the previous frame.

noise from freezer.(WhOOOO-oooooh, WHOOO-oooooh,......) annoying with doors closed, worse with freezer door open.



Watched some videos on youtube after typing in : refrigerator noise, and my model # (in search bar.) Found a video after determining my problem of a gentleman from partselect replacing the evaporator motor. Pretty simple job from video so I went for it ordered parts from them( I fixed the inlet valve on my dishwasher bfore with partselect
                            ... Read more
 before). I would call the job easier than it looks. But you need common sense and simple tools and some experience with nuts and bolts and wires. There is one bolt tucked up high under ice maker you may need a right angle nut driver or 1/4  right angle ratchet.(video pointed out). Thanks for video and quality GE parts. I now have a quiet kitchen and great room, with just a low db constant white noise like new.

Ice tray was one solid ice cube



Leaking icemaker assembly was causing all of the ice cubes in the ice tray to freeze together. Remove ice tray, remove one Philips screw, pull the cover off, unplug the wires, remove the icemaker assembly by pushing tab and pulling the assembly at the same time. Replaced the water filter as well.

Auto water stopped working, found that filter needed replacement



Unscrewed old cartridge, ordered new cartridge, installed new cartridge by following very simple instructions.  Took only one day for part to arrive from PartSelect although I paid for cheapest shipping, which was "ground."  I was amazed!

Ice and Water Filter needed replacement



I watched the video, and noticed that they did not even turn off the water. The replacement took less than 30 seconds once the filter was filled with water.

With daily use how long should this filter need replaced



Hi Denise, 

Thank you for your inquiry. It is recommended that, with daily use of your water and ice system, you replace your filter at least once per year. I hope this helps!

I just want to make sure i am understanding the cross reference for my water filter.Per my model number it calls for a mwf filter.The filter online shows it is for a mswf.They are compatible correct? I would not need to purchase any adapter? This is a new refrigerator.Thank you.
For model number GSS23GSKGCSS



Hi Stephen, Thank you for the question. The new upgraded filter for your model number is listed as MWFP. If you have not installed the new filter you will need the Adapter, PartSelect #: PS220347. Hope this helps!

I just installed a new water filter and my refrigerator stopped making ice,  it does dispense water.
For model number GSHS6HGDBCSS



Hello Judy, thank you for your question. Check the fill tube and fill cup that brings water to the icemaker. It could be clogged with ice. If there is no ice obstructing the tube and cup, test the water inlet valve to be sure both ports on the valve are working. Here is a link on how to test the water valve. https://www.partselect.com/Refrigerator+test-water-valve+repair.htm. You can also try to run the following test on the icemaker itself.Turn icemaker Off for 15 seconds and turn back on,Push in on paddle 3 times and only 3 times within 15 seconds of powering the icemaker back on.Within 3 minutes, the icemaker should enter the harvest mode.The heater will turn on for a about of 20 seconds, and the comb inside the icemaker will make one full revolution and return to the "Home" position.At the end of 3 minutes, the icemaker mold should fill with water.The green light under the ON/OFF switch should be on and steady.If this does not fix the issue you may need to replace the icemaker.  I hope this helps!

Is this filter compatable for my refrigerator? Or do i need to the adapter?
For model number GSS25GGHECWW



Hello Turo, thank you for your question. Yes, the filter part number MWFP is the right part for your appliance. However, this is an updated water filter. If you have never installed the updated part or your old model was made by Culligan, you may need the adapter to install the filter. The 	
Water Filter Adapter is Part Number 220347. I hope this helps!

I have two lines in back of my fridge one of them is just a tube with an opening at the tip. The other has a fitting on it what are they for i’m quite sure the one with the screw cap on it is for the water line what’s the other one for
For model number GSH25GGCBBB



Hi Ray, 

Thank you for your question. The only plastic tube lines that you should have in your fridge are water lines. Anything copper has to do with your compressor. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.

Refrigerator Ice and Water Filter Specifications
This is an OEM replacement ice and water filter for your refrigerator. In side-by-side refrigerators, it is found in the top right corner or the bottom left grille. In bottom-freezer refrigerators, the filter is in the bottom left grille. In top-freezer units, the filter is located in the middle of the refrigerator. This NSF certified filter reduces 28 contaminants including pharmaceuticals, metals, minerals, pesticides, cysts, industrial chemicals, Class I Particulates and chlorine. It is made up of coconut carbon block and has three layers of filtration. The first layer is particle filtration that helps block larger contaminants. The second layer is micro-filtration, which prevents medium-sized impurities from passing. The third layer is called absorption filtration, which absorbs microscopic-sized pollutants. It measures 2 inches deep, 2 inches wide, 1-1/2 inches high, and weighs 0.5 lbs. To ensure your filter is working its best, it needs to be replaced every six months. This single filter has a simple, quick-turn installation feature that does not require any tools.

When the filter was removed the housing leaked.



I would suggest loosening the supply lines attached inside the rear. This will give you plenty of slack to disconnect the lines from the housing.

I have this Whirlpool and can not find where water filter is.
For model number WRS325FDAM04



Hi Ken,

Thank you for your inquiry. For your model, the filter is hidden behind a small panel on the left hand side of your kickplate at the bottom of your refrigerator. You should be able to just open that panel and replace your filter. Good luck with your repair.

To replace the water filter, the small door on the left side of the kick plate should open.  Does it open from the right or the left?  It is hard to open and I'm afraid to force it as a previous question said they broke it off and it can't be easily fixed.
For model number KSC24C8EYB02



Hi Susan, Thank you for the question. Looks like your door opens from the bottom. Hope this helps!

How do I repair the spring loaded door where the water filter goes. The spring came off and it is supposed to pull out the water filter when you open the little door with the spring.
For model number WRS325FDAB02



Hi Betty,

Thank you for the question. The only way to repair the filter door would be to replace the filter housing. Unfortunately they do not sell the door parts separately. 

Hope this helps!

Refrigerator Door Shelf Bin Specifications
This manufacturer-certified Refrigerator Door Shelf Bin, also known as a crisper bin or door shelf bin, is made of clear plastic, and is easy to install. It is used to hold items in the fridge, like jars, cans, and condiments and you'll be able to visually see if the part is broken or cracked. This particular shelf attaches to the fridge door. You can check if this model is right for your appliance by checking your user manual and model number. This part should simply snap into place without the need for any tools as part of the repair. Just carefully line up the slots on the door with the slots on the bin and slide the bin down to completely lock it into place. The part is sold individually, and fits many different types of side-by-side refrigerators.

The door bin on my Refrigerator broke



I received two bins as ordered. I could not use one because it was broken. I sent an email back to Parts Select about the bin broken in the shipment. Heard nothing back.  I did not know that the door bins were different sizes for the top of the door & bottom 2 bins. So now I have one bin that fits, One that doesn't fit & a broken on
                            ... Read more
e that does not fit.  Moral of the story? Take my money & send me a broken part & that does not fit due to Frigidaire having two different sizes. I have never owned a more noisy refrigerator in my life except the refrigerator a GE, that I replaced with this one. It got very noisy before it quit.

Old shelf fell out on the floor and broke



When I went to install the new shelf, I saw two small ridges near where the shelf mounts on either end of the door. It was possible to slide the new shelf in behind the ridges, making a tighter fit for the shelf.  Probably this was not done when the refrigerator was delivered and installed by the delivery person.

Looking at your refrigerator door diagram, can you give me the style numbers for the two different size door bins and their respective dimensions? I am not sure which one I wish to buy.Thanks
For model number LFSS2612TF0



Hello Arthur, Thank you for contacting us. I have researched the model you have provided and have found the part you are looking for is Part #: PS430122 for the top two bins and Part #: PS12364199 for the bottom two bins. These are the bins to fit your appliance. Since the measurements we have go by a 1" grid and the bins do not sit flat we do not have the exact dimensions but we can guarantee these are correct for your appliance using the model number. Hope this helps!

I received this part as promised, thank you. Is there a secret in installing this? I know its supposed to snap in so to speak, so what am I doing wrong?  I am totally challenged when it comes to doing anything in the home.  Thanks for your help.  Arthur
For model number PS12364199

BELT DRIVE Specifications
This Drive Belt is 89.5" long and comes in black, featuring four ribs on the inside for a better grip. This is a long belt that wraps all the way around the dryer drum, around a tension pulley, and then around the drive motor pulley, allowing all the parts to work together, spinning the drum as the motor rotates. If the drum will not turn when the dryer is turned on the belt is likely broken. It is common for belts to stretch or become brittle over time, which is what leads to the breakage. If broken, it should be replaced; the drum simply cannot spin without this belt. Refer to your model number and user manual to check if this part is right for you. Ensure you use work gloves to protect your hands from sharp internal parts during this repair. Please note: When comparing the length of your old belt to the length of the belt as stated here, remember that a small amount of stretching and contortion may occur with belts over time for a range of different reasons. Unless your belt is drastically different in length, this belt is what you are looking for despite any small inaccuracies. You will need to remove power to your appliance, remove the main panel, and access the motor drive to slip your new belt back into place.

Dryer was making increasingly loud "thumping" sound.



Parts were shipped quickly, packaged correctly, and were in original GM packages - very reassuring.  BTW, your customer service is excellent.Reviewed YouTube videos.Patience is required, take your time, take photos of the wires and also make a written wiring chart.  This was the flaw in my planning.  Reference the schematics f
                            ... Read more
rom PartsSelect to number the controls.  Do NOT use masking tape to identify the wires as they will have all stuck together by the time you go to reinstall them.   Most difficult process was removing and identifying the numerous wires to the back panel.  They have push connectors, but some were very difficult to remove.  The people doing the "how to" videos no doubt had them partially released and that made it look easy. Examine the connectors before removing to identify how they are captured by the connector.  A paper clip "tool" I made enabled me to release some of the capture lugs, but some were so tight, I had to use small needle-nose pliers to open up the lug to release the wire on the connector.   When reinstalling, re-tighten those connectors.Replacing the parts was much easier than the wiring disconnect/reconnect process.  I'm happy to report that replacing the rear bearing and the front 2 green and 2 white shim/bearings immediately and completely solved my problem.  For about $150, I restored my dryer to "like-new" functionality and got a lot of satisfaction from doing it.  The project took about 4 hours, which could have been reduced to 2 hours had I know about the clip release and wiring identification process.  Also, make sure you thoroughly vacuum out your unit while it is disassembled.  Good luck!!!

t were likely excessively worn--white and green bearing slides (two of each required), rear drum bearing kit, drive belt, and idler pulley wheel--to address the noisiness issue.For your consideration: Since our dryer is 12 years old and would be disassembled anyway, I decided to order a new dryer drum belt and idler pulley, to replace these two constant-use items as preventive maintenance.Two notes.One: When replacing the dryer drum bearing parts, you need a T25 torx bit to loosen and remove the three torx-head screws. But using my T25 torx bit-head-style screwdriver, it was impossible to loosen them. Fortunately, I had a T25 torx bit, which I could mount in a socket wrench, which DID allow me to loosen those three torx-head screws without damage/breakage. WHEW! Recommend you are similarly prepared!Two: If you purchase the "Rear Drum Bearing Kit," it already comes with the the "Drum Bearing Sleeve" and "Retainer O-Ring" components I thought I would also need--no need to purchase separately. I returned those two items, unopened, for a refund.All together, from dryer disassembly to, component replacement, to a thorough vacuuming/cleaning, to reassembly and an operational check, it took about four hours. The dryer is now nearly noiseless again! Success!I consider myself reasonably good with tools and have a fair amount of electrical and mechanical skill. My wife assisted with extra hands a couple times, too, seriously reducing my frustration level. Depending on your abilities, you'll take more time or less time than the four hours it took me. I'm certain I saved at least a couple hundred dollars by doing this maintenance myself.In summary, the PartSelect person taking my order was knowledgeable and professional, I received my parts two days after ordering, the parts worked perfectly, and the company refunded my two, unopened returned parts promptly. Overall, a terrific experience. I highly recommend them to any capable do-it-yourselfer.Thanks, PartSelect!

Dyer made a squealing/screeching noise



I have read other postings which describe most of the procedure very well, so I'm just going to add things that should be considered, which I have not read about here. Removing the drum proved difficult due to the lack of room on the two sides.The vent blower motor bracket is at the front bottom of the dryer, and when the two screws
                            ... Read more
 on either the left or right side are removed, the dryer sides spread more easily and allow the drum to be removed or re-installed more easily. Next, the rear drum bearing I bought has a rubber o-ring which holds it in place. There is a good chance this o-ring will be hard and brittle after years of service, and will crumble when removed, in order to replace the bearing. I had to run to the local hardware store to get a new o-ring, and could only find one that did was not rated for high heat usage. I presumed once the drum is re-installed that the bearing can't dislodge even with a missing o-ring. I think it just holds the bearing in place while removing and re-installing the drum, but I cannot be certain about this.So if you plan to replace the rear drum bearing, make sure to also order the o-ring that holds it in place. It is doubtful you can re-use the old one depending on the age of your dryer.Replacing the old white belt tensioning pulley requires the removal and re-installation of a "nut" that has no threads. It is forced on and off and not simple to re-install. The removal was easy simply by using a wrench to "unscrew" it counterclockwise. But re-installing it is another matter. It requires force to get it back onto the shaft. I saw a tip to use a 7/16" socket placed over the nut and hit with a hammer while bracing the bracket from the other side. I did this by used a smaller tool, linesman's pliers, which provided the force needed. Install it about 1/4" past the end of the bracket shaft. Careful, that nut has sharp edges and I ended up bleeding from that process. Three hands would help: one to brace the bracket, one to hold the nut and socket in place, and one to hammer. So good luck with that. Probably there is a smarter way to do this.If you replace the old white plastic belt tensioning pulley with a new yellow one, it is not simple to understand how to re-install the belt properly. The videos do not do the trick adequately. I did find one on youtube where they removed the dryer side in order to show the belt installation and I had an "aha moment". Since you cannot see the belt, the pulleys, the motor, or anything else during installation, it is not a simple thing to do. Here are my tips: Before re-installing the drum, move the belt tensioning pulley bracket to the right (when facing the dryer front) and you will see a little spot where the bracket will stay to the right when engaged in this spot. Engage the bracket and then proceed to re-install the drum. That way, when you reach under the drum to set the belt properly on the pulleys, you won't have to engage the tensioning bracket without being able to see. Once the belt is in place, carefully remove the bracket from the right holding spot and allow it to move back to the left operating position. I used two hands and don't think I could have done it with one. When the belts are new, they can be naturally twisted and you have to be careful to install the belt with no twist. I had to do it twice to get it right. If someone can take up the top belt slack for you, it's easy to feel the belt underneath the drum and get any twists out.Next, i had a hard time inserting the drum back into the dryer and finding the hole where the bearing inserts. The problem is, if you are not careful, it's easy to move, bend, or break the heater wires which surround the hole you need to locate blindly and slip the drum bearing into. I did bend those wires, but luckily not break them.  In hindsight, applying some masking tape to the rear inside panel of the dryer right at the top, left and right of the drum BEFORE removing the drum would have made it much easier estimating the proper drum height while maneuvering the bearing into the rear hole. Then remove the masking tape when done. I ordered a new top plastic front bearing that supports the drum in the front. Good thing I did because mine was split about 5" where one set of the green and white sliders install. I had one white "plastic" insert visible. The other one plus the two green bearings were totally missing. No wonder it was squealing.Finally, the hardest part for me was re-installing the top of the dryer! Take a good look before removing it so you can see exactly how the top fits to the dryer and how the parts need to be lined up first. Thanks to PartSelect.com! Every part was correct and the installation videos gave me so much help. Also, parts arrived in two days, which surprised me. I will be ordering all parts here.

Squeaking



Replace the front and rear bearings. When I have to do it again I will only order (3106), (313), 2x (316) green, 2x (316) white, and drive belt. Taking it apart and putting it back together was easy. Unplug the unit. Take out the 2 philips screws that hold on the top. Lift the top from the front to clear the locking tabs in the back and t
                            ... Read more
ake it off. Take out the 2 5/16 screws that hold on the front. Tilt the front (door) forward and rest the drum on the dryer sides, you'll see it. Disconnect the wiring harness for the light and door switch, 2 wires. Lift the front off the bottom retaining clips and place aside. Have someone hold up the drum. Reach under and unhook the drive belt. Pull out the drum assembly. Take off the rear bearing, 3 screws. Clean out the heating element area in the back of the dryer while you have a chance. Replace the bearing assembly. I bought the entire bearing assembly but I could have gotten away with just the sleeve ( 3106), but I didn't know that at the time. Take off and replace the drive belt. Lock the tension arm for the drive belt into the compressed position shelf holder by the motor, push the arm down, you'll see it. Replace the drum and have someone hold it up while you rehook the drive belt and release the tension arm. Now, I would suggest replacing the entire front bearing. If the slides have been bad for a while, the plastic bearing (housing) is probably worn out and cracked. I had to order a front bearing assembly because the new slides wouldn't work with the worn out assembly, no big deal, it came quick. Unscrew the light bulb. Slowly pull the assembly away from the top of the front metal panel, slowly, and pay attention to where everything lines up. Replace the new front bearing and put the new slides on the little plastic tabs, be careful so you don't snap them off. Green on top, white on the sides. Replace the lightbulb. Set the front panel into place on the tabs at the bottom of the dryer. Rehook the door wires (2), and have someone hold up the drum while you slide the front bearing into the drum. Holding the front panel in place, turn the drum by hand and check for binding, things that don't sound or look right. Replace the 2 nuts to hold on the front. Plug it in, keep your hands back, turn it on, look, listen, everything fine. Open door, unplug, replace the top and the 2 screws that hold it on. Plug in, turn it on and check for any noise, you shouldn't hear any. If you do, you didn't do something right or maybe your drive pulleys are bad. A good dad and son job; especially getting on the ground and reaching under to deal with the drive belt. Watch out for sharp edges on the sheet metal and be slow and careful with the front plastic bearing so it doesn't snap. Your now good for 5 more years. A 2 on the difficulty scale, just take it slow and have an extra set of hands.

How do you if it is the belt? This just stop after turning it on.
Does it need two belts?
For model number GTDP280ED0WW



Hello Jerri, Thank you for your inquiry. Check the belt for any excessive wear and tear and to see if it came off the pulley. The model number that you have provided only uses one belt. The other causes of this issue could be a faulty drive motor, a faulty belt interlock switch, or a faulty door switch. You can test the parts with a multimeter. If you are unfamiliar with how a multimeter functions, we have videos available to assist you. Good luck with your repair.

How do I replace this bin



Hello Casey, thanks for reaching out to us. If the old bin is still in place, simply grab onto it with both hands and lift it away from the door, it should come right off. To install your new bin, line it up where the old bin was and simply drop it into place. Good luck with your repair.

I want to make sure this door unit fits my frig.  Not sure where you are measuring width--at front it might be 14 1/4, but at back it is wider and more like 16"  also rather than 6" deep, it is more like 7 1/2.  Am i ordering the right cantilever part?
For model number ED5FVGXWS01



Hello Cindy, thank you for your question. We put all of our pictures of parts on a 1 inch square grid to help give an approximate measurement. At the front the bin would be about 14 1/4 and the back is a bit wider at about 16 inches. So part number WPW10321304 is the correct bin for the fridge door. I hope this helps!

Electrical connection pulled off the element



When I pulled the element out of the back panel of the oven to remove it, the electrical connection got caught on the edge of the hole in the panel and disappeared back into the oven insulation.  It was difficult to find and pull it back out to reinstall it on the new element.

ull the wires off the element ends. You should be able to do this by hand; use a flathead screwdriver for a little prying if necessary. Visually inspect the element for physical damage. If you don’t see any, test the element with an ohmmeter or multimeter. If it reads anything other than 0 ohms (continuity), your element is defective. Installation process is reverse of removal.

I think it would be good to tell people to make sure the power is off



Hi William, thank you for contacting us. Yes, it is always best that before doing any repair you make sure your appliance is not connected to power so that you do not harm yourself or break something else on the appliance. Have a great day.

If my bottom heating element is broken can it cause the top part of the stove to not hear correctly
For model number TEF361GSB



Hello Dustin, thank you for your question. No, any oven issues shouldn't cause the top burners to be affected. The top burners are controlled by burner switches behind the temperature knobs and the oven control board and oven sensor control the oven elements and heating. I hope this helps.

My bottom element heats fine. Since i purchased a new element some time back i have smut on my lower part of oven and on the element every time i cook something. I do not know what causes it. Will a new element help? Thank you.
For model number FEFL64FSD



Hello Betty, Thank you for contacting us. It is possible that the bake element is faulty. I suggest checking it with a multimeter. You should get a reading between 0-50 ohms. Good luck with your repair!

Door Shelf Retainer Bar Specifications
This door shelf retaining bar, also known as refrigerator door bar retainer or fridge door rack, is a genuine part sourced from the original manufacturer. It is a white This manufacturer-certified Door Shelf Retainer Bar, sometimes otherwise known as the door rack or bar retainer,  is a white, plastic part which can be easily installed onto the inside of the refrigerator or freezer door to hold items on the door shelves.  It holds items in your fridge and will show physical damage if broken or warped, at which time it should be replaced. Check your user manual and model number to see if this part is right for you. No tools are required for this installation, the part should simply snap into place. This part measures roughly 25 inches wide, 3 inches high, and 5 inches deep. This part is sold individually, and we recommend checking the other door shelf retaining bars on your refrigerator or freezer at the same time as ordering this part to ensure that no others need to be replaced, as they often wear or warp at similar speeds.

Just the right fit!
We had battled with our cracked/breaking fridge door shelf retainer bar for years, trying to coax it along.  Finally it had had enough!  I order the part, slipped it right in & sent the old one packing!  Everyone was astounded at how well it fit.  My son said, "You mean to tell me it was this easy all along to get a new one?"  Oh goodness!!  We are just thrilled, to not have our condiments come flying out onto the floor at random moments!  Thanks so much!!!

Perfect Fit
I'm always skeptical when I buy a "factory replacement part" from someone other than the factory.  But ....

Part was delivered days earlier than expected.  
Took it out of the box, popped it right in, fit & color match were perfect.  
Unpacking, replacement and trash removal took less than 10 minutes.

Fridge door shelf bar
Fit perfectly onto the door. However, $50.00 for a piece of plastic is a bit outrageous.

The fit was good even though the top retainer bar seems to be a tighter more secure fit than the middle retainer bar.The retainer bars are made to simply snap into place.  Great to receive these replacement shelf retainer bars.  Thanks!!

Randy
July 20, 2017

When I opened my fridge door today I used too much power and the door flew open and all the things on the top shelf went crashing and I warped the bar on the top shelf. I’m not sure what it’s called but now every time I open my fridge door I have to be careful otherwise everything will fall out. Is there any way I can fix this part? If not what do I need to replace it, will I need to buy tools too?



Hi Randy, unfortunately sometimes the shelf retainer bars can snap or warp, and when this happens you need to replace them. This would be the top shelf bar, and no tools are required to make this repair. Best of luck!

I am sorry I do not understand which part you are referring to in reagrds to the "brackets". The connection pieces for the bars will come already attached to the retainer bar.

My retainer bar is not staying in place but I know it is the right one that I need can you help



Hello Marianna, we recommend checking the part for damage on either end, if it is not damaged make sure to apply some pressure when installing it on to your refrigerator door. These parts can be fragile so be careful not to apply too much pressure. You will know the bar is in the right place when you hear a clicking sound as it settles. I hope this helps.

Refrigerator Water Filter Specifications
This water filter (Whirlpool EveryDrop Refrigerator Water Filter, Single Turn Filter) purifies water going to the water dispenser and sometimes the icemaker as well. This part should be replaced if it is causing reduced water flow or just replaced periodically per the owner manual. Replacing this water filter may fix a noisy or leaking fridge, a fridge that is not dispensing water (or reduced flow rate), and an ice maker that is not making ice at all, or not making enough ice. This filter is white, sold individually and measures 8 inches by 3 inches in diameter. This water filter has been updated by the manufacturer. It may appear different but will still function the same. It is sold individually.

entire freezer compartment was cascaded in ice and icemaker had been noisy



Turn off power first or unplug. Get a light so you can see. Read these directions through one time to reduce the learning curve. Remove ice cube bin. 1/4" nut-driver will do most of the work. Remove flexible water fill tube from back of ice cube maker, move to the side, out of the way. Remove screw from "L" shaped bracket from the bottom 
                            ... Read more
of maker, close to the front. Two more 1/4" screws to go. There are (2) screws on the top left that hold the maker to wall. Loosen the front screw, but do not totally remove, unit will lift off of front screw. The back screw had to be completely removed because of a clip that holds the wiring on the back of the maker. The wiring is attached to the back wall in the form of what is called a Molex connector, a white plastic connector. This is probably the hardest part of the job, wiring access. The air deflector blocks any free access, so you have to just grab and depress the prongs to release the Molex from the wall. With wiring disconnected, remove entire assembly. Use a flat-tip screwdriver to pop the white cover off of the front of the maker to use on the new one. Same goes for the wire cube arm that sets out over the ice cube bin, taking the front out first (pulling straightout) then pivot arm 180 degrees and remove from back. Remove wiring harness from front of maker. Re-install on maker, it goes in one direction only, look at the configuration before you pull it out, and put in the same way. Make absolutely sure you re-install it so it clicks in all the way. If not, it won't work. I had to remove the ice maker again because I did not make this connection properly the first time. So I did the whole job twice. You have to put the job back in reverse of the way you took it out. The new one works great. I should have done this about a year ago. The old one had been making a noise and I ignored it.

Replacing filter



Really easy, simple instructions, and it was on my doorstep 3 days after I ordered.  Much simpler than dealing with the appliance store, where I'd have to drive to the store, order the filter, wait 7-10 days, and return to pick it up.  Ughh!  Internet is the way to go!

I changed the water filter in my fridge because the order and replace light went from green to red. Now that its been replaced how do I make the light go back to green? Will it reboot on its own?



Hi Brian, after replacing the filter you can hold the reset filter pad for 3 seconds. This should turn the light off. Best of luck with this repair.

My icemaker just stopped making ice and I know I need to replace the water filter ive just been dragging my feet about it. Is the icemaker cut off now because I need to replace my filter or is there another reason for it stopping now?



Hello Jones, we recommend replacing the water filter every 6 months, depending on how often you use it. Replacing or not replacing the filter would only affect the water dispenser, not the icemaker. The most common reason an icemaker does not get water would be a defective water valve WPW10270395. I hope this helps.

I just replaced my water filter on my Whirlpool gold however its making ice but its not dispensing water or ice. What van i do?
For model number G15SVAXVL01



Hi Ivan,
Thank you for your question.  If there is no water or ice being dispensed, I would check the switch in the dispenser with a multimeter to see if it is working correctly.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!

How do you remove water filter?
For model number wrx735sdbm00



Hello Richard,

Thanks for your question. Open up the fridge section, and the filter will be in the back corner of the compartment. Open up the plastic covering. You will need to twist the filter counterclockwise, then remove it.

I hope this helps.

Our fridge section is too cold. Adjusting the digital thermostat does not seem to help much.Water filter replacement comes up as the #1 solution.How does the water filter function affect fridge temp? Does seem to make sense.  Thanks.
For model number GZ25FSRXYY0



Hi Steve, Thank you for the question, The suggestions are based on previous customers and what reason they gave for replacing a part. A customer replacing the filter may have clicked the wrong option in error. I suggest checking to make sure the Damper Control Assembly is not stuck open and allowing too much cold air through from the freezer. You can check to see if the flapper has froze open or if there is something blocking the flapper not allowing it to close.Hope this helps!

I didn't know I had to replace my water filter in my fridge. How often do you recommend we replace them?



Hi Jauna, we recommend replacing the water filter every 6 months to guarantee impurities are properly removed from your water, and there is a consistent flow rate. Please let us know if you have any further questions.

My refrigerator is leaking water into the freezer. My model has the freezer on the bottom. Which part do you think i need
For model number gz25fsrxyy0



Hello Walter,

Thank you for the great question. Checking the symptom list something to check would be the water filter, If it needs to be replaced it might leak or if it is loose.You can also check to see if the reservoir tank at the back of the appliance has no leaks or the lines going to the tank. 

I hope this helps!

The water filter cover keeps on opening and the filter keeps dropping down.  The little plastic clip is not holding the door in place.  I can't seem to find the part anywhere for my kitchen aide refrigerator.  I am using a soda bottle to  hold the filter in place.
For model number kfis27cxwh3



Hello Greg, Thank you for your inquiry. The latch or clip for the filter cover is part# WP2223877. Hope this helps!

The install video does not show shutting the water.  Is it not necessary to shut off the water?
For model number MFI2269FRW00



Hi Charles,
Thank you for your question.  No, you will not need to turn the water off to perform this repair.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!

When I opened the filter cover the filter did not drop down like it did in the video. It is lodged in the compartment. How do I release it?
For model number MF12269FRZ02



Hello Wayne, Thank you for the question. If the filter is stuck, you may need to remove the Filter bracket, Part #: PS2069868 and cover Part #: PS11743682 to remove the filter. I also suggest checking them for any damage causing the filter to get stuck. Hope this helps!

The original drawer had chipped along the glides and would not close properly



The refrigerator had to be pulled away from the wall far enough to permit the door to open fully, but no tools were needed and no difficulty was encountered. Removed the old drawer and discarded it. Inserted the new drawer and closed the humidifier vent. Pushed the refrigerator back in place. Job done.

I cannot tell if this is the right drawer for my fridge. I am looking for a humidity drawer that is about 14 inches long and 16.5 wide and 8 inches deep. What are the measurements



Hi Anthony, great question. Based on the information provided by the manufacturer this part is 14.92 inches long, 7.6 inches high, and 16.5 inches wide. I hope this helps!

Regina

Your website led me here to replace my broken drawer. But in the picture your part says Humidity Control and mine says Produce Saver. Is this really the part I need? TIA



Hello Regina, this is the right drawer/bin WP2188656 that you’re looking for and it is a replacement part sourced directly from the manufacturer. Occasionally this will happen where it will not match your drawer word for word. However, it will fit in your fridge and will work just the same as the part it is replacing. I hope this clears things up for you!

Shauna
July 20, 2017

Can you confirm this is the part I need for my fridge? The bottom of my crisper drawer is cracked and needs replacing. With that said my fridge is a different brand than the manual, and the drawer is a different brand than both the manual and the fridge. Is that normal?



Hello Shauna, thanks for the question! This can get a little confusing sometimes because the unit was built by Whirlpool but it is branded as a Kenmore, and yes this is a common occurrence. Rest assured that this is the correct crisper pan WP2188656 for your model, and it is an OEM replacement part. Please let us know if you have any further questions.

This authentic, white Drum Bearing Slide, also known as the bearing drum slide, glide, or pad, is a plastic, easy-to-install part for your dryer. It replaces the dryer's front drum slide to allow for easier movement.  You'll know if this part is an issue if your dryer is unable to tumble properly or is very noisy. Damage can come from regular use. The part attaches to the outermost side of the bearing. Check both slides for signs of wear, because they often wear at the same rate, and should be replaced at the same time; there are 2 of these particular slides per dryer. This part is sold individually, so you'll need to purchase multiple parts if replacing both at the same time.

When at first you don't succeed...
OEM packaged replacement part in perfect condition fit perfectly.  Repair was made but did not solve the problem completely and additional work is needed.  I will probably need to replace drum bearings too.

Dryer was making loud noise



Upon receiving the parts, we went to the video repair instructions.  We found these videos to be very well done and very helpful.  It was great being able to pause the video at specific points until we were able to complete that step of the repair.  All of the replacement parts fit correctly and there were no issues.

Excessive Drum Noise While Drying Clothes



The PartSelect company's "how to" repair videos are OUTSTANDING. Thank you! The videos provided a comprehensive overview of what to expect in terms of clothes dryer disassembly, component replacement and reassembly. The videos were invaluable tutorials for prior-to-disassembly work.I ordered all the following parts which I fel
                            ... Read more
t were likely excessively worn--white and green bearing slides (two of each required), rear drum bearing kit, drive belt, and idler pulley wheel--to address the noisiness issue.For your consideration: Since our dryer is 12 years old and would be disassembled anyway, I decided to order a new dryer drum belt and idler pulley, to replace these two constant-use items as preventive maintenance.Two notes.One: When replacing the dryer drum bearing parts, you need a T25 torx bit to loosen and remove the three torx-head screws. But using my T25 torx bit-head-style screwdriver, it was impossible to loosen them. Fortunately, I had a T25 torx bit, which I could mount in a socket wrench, which DID allow me to loosen those three torx-head screws without damage/breakage. WHEW! Recommend you are similarly prepared!Two: If you purchase the "Rear Drum Bearing Kit," it already comes with the the "Drum Bearing Sleeve" and "Retainer O-Ring" components I thought I would also need--no need to purchase separately. I returned those two items, unopened, for a refund.All together, from dryer disassembly to, component replacement, to a thorough vacuuming/cleaning, to reassembly and an operational check, it took about four hours. The dryer is now nearly noiseless again! Success!I consider myself reasonably good with tools and have a fair amount of electrical and mechanical skill. My wife assisted with extra hands a couple times, too, seriously reducing my frustration level. Depending on your abilities, you'll take more time or less time than the four hours it took me. I'm certain I saved at least a couple hundred dollars by doing this maintenance myself.In summary, the PartSelect person taking my order was knowledgeable and professional, I received my parts two days after ordering, the parts worked perfectly, and the company refunded my two, unopened returned parts promptly. Overall, a terrific experience. I highly recommend them to any capable do-it-yourselfer.Thanks, PartSelect!

I am a 55 year old woman who likes to repair household items. I followed You Tube instructions and did it all by myself.  A few screws to get the top off and a two more to remove the front piece.

uld rewind and watch as I did it.  The hardest part was I dropped one of the screws when placing the front of the dryer back on and had to find another one that was the same size.  Luckily I have lots of old screws in my tool box,  If you like to do small simple repairs to save some money this is an easy one.

Dyer made a squealing/screeching noise



I have read other postings which describe most of the procedure very well, so I'm just going to add things that should be considered, which I have not read about here. Removing the drum proved difficult due to the lack of room on the two sides.The vent blower motor bracket is at the front bottom of the dryer, and when the two screws
                            ... Read more
 on either the left or right side are removed, the dryer sides spread more easily and allow the drum to be removed or re-installed more easily. Next, the rear drum bearing I bought has a rubber o-ring which holds it in place. There is a good chance this o-ring will be hard and brittle after years of service, and will crumble when removed, in order to replace the bearing. I had to run to the local hardware store to get a new o-ring, and could only find one that did was not rated for high heat usage. I presumed once the drum is re-installed that the bearing can't dislodge even with a missing o-ring. I think it just holds the bearing in place while removing and re-installing the drum, but I cannot be certain about this.So if you plan to replace the rear drum bearing, make sure to also order the o-ring that holds it in place. It is doubtful you can re-use the old one depending on the age of your dryer.Replacing the old white belt tensioning pulley requires the removal and re-installation of a "nut" that has no threads. It is forced on and off and not simple to re-install. The removal was easy simply by using a wrench to "unscrew" it counterclockwise. But re-installing it is another matter. It requires force to get it back onto the shaft. I saw a tip to use a 7/16" socket placed over the nut and hit with a hammer while bracing the bracket from the other side. I did this by used a smaller tool, linesman's pliers, which provided the force needed. Install it about 1/4" past the end of the bracket shaft. Careful, that nut has sharp edges and I ended up bleeding from that process. Three hands would help: one to brace the bracket, one to hold the nut and socket in place, and one to hammer. So good luck with that. Probably there is a smarter way to do this.If you replace the old white plastic belt tensioning pulley with a new yellow one, it is not simple to understand how to re-install the belt properly. The videos do not do the trick adequately. I did find one on youtube where they removed the dryer side in order to show the belt installation and I had an "aha moment". Since you cannot see the belt, the pulleys, the motor, or anything else during installation, it is not a simple thing to do. Here are my tips: Before re-installing the drum, move the belt tensioning pulley bracket to the right (when facing the dryer front) and you will see a little spot where the bracket will stay to the right when engaged in this spot. Engage the bracket and then proceed to re-install the drum. That way, when you reach under the drum to set the belt properly on the pulleys, you won't have to engage the tensioning bracket without being able to see. Once the belt is in place, carefully remove the bracket from the right holding spot and allow it to move back to the left operating position. I used two hands and don't think I could have done it with one. When the belts are new, they can be naturally twisted and you have to be careful to install the belt with no twist. I had to do it twice to get it right. If someone can take up the top belt slack for you, it's easy to feel the belt underneath the drum and get any twists out.Next, i had a hard time inserting the drum back into the dryer and finding the hole where the bearing inserts. The problem is, if you are not careful, it's easy to move, bend, or break the heater wires which surround the hole you need to locate blindly and slip the drum bearing into. I did bend those wires, but luckily not break them.  In hindsight, applying some masking tape to the rear inside panel of the dryer right at the top, left and right of the drum BEFORE removing the drum would have made it much easier estimating the proper drum height while maneuvering the bearing into the rear hole. Then remove the masking tape when done. I ordered a new top plastic front bearing that supports the drum in the front. Good thing I did because mine was split about 5" where one set of the green and white sliders install. I had one white "plastic" insert visible. The other one plus the two green bearings were totally missing. No wonder it was squealing.Finally, the hardest part for me was re-installing the top of the dryer! Take a good look before removing it so you can see exactly how the top fits to the dryer and how the parts need to be lined up first. Thanks to PartSelect.com! Every part was correct and the installation videos gave me so much help. Also, parts arrived in two days, which surprised me. I will be ordering all parts here.

I’m changing all the bearing slides on my dryer how many do I need and why are they different colors?



Hi Brent, the bearing slides are different colors to tell the difference between them. If you are replacing the front bearing slides in your dryer you will need 2 lower slides WE1M504, which are white. You will also need two upper slides WE1M1067, which are green. Good luck with this repair.

Do I need 2 white slides and 2 Green slides for this dryer? If so do the slides come as a set or are they single? In other words when I order the white slide is it a set of 2 or just a single slide?
For model number DHDSR48EF2WW



Hi Glenn. You will need to order 2 of the white slides and 2 of the green slides. They are sold individually . Hope this helps!

My dryer is making a terribly loud noise when I first turn it on. Is there a kit or something I should get for it? Ive been looking at your parts list and if I change the top drum bearing I think I will need the drum slide bearings. How many do I need and which ones should I order??? Are there any other parts I should order to stop the noise? Thanks for the help!



Hi Nina, great question. Changing your front bearings would be your first step as worn ones can cause loud noises throughout the drying cycle. To change the upper bearings, you will need 2 of WE1M504 and 2 of WE1M1067. If you decide to also change the rear bearing which would be the second most common cause for the noise, the part would be WE25M40. Let us know if you have any further questions.

While drying it is making a squeaking noise that is coming and going like it maybe the belt squeaking
For model number DBXR463GD1WW



Hi Bobby,

Thank you for your inquiry. Your belt could be the issue. If it has worn down so much that maybe it is slipping against the pulley. However it is more likely that you will have to replace either your bearing slides or your pulley. I would check all of these parts to see which one of them are causing your problem. They are all physical parts, so when you look at them you should be able to determine which one is causing the problem for you. The belt and the slides would be parts that get worn down, the pulley is just something that you turn the wheel on and you will hear if it is making the squeaking noise. Good luck with your repair.

I bought and am currently replacing the rear bearings. Since the dryer is already pulled apart how can I tell if I should replace the front bearings or the support?



Hello Calista, thanks for getting in touch. You will know to replace the front bearings or the support if you see any visible damage. Wear is normal, but if the parts are damaged in any way they should be replaced. I hope this helps!

The dryer is not drying loads in normal time. It is also making a noise as if something is flopping around inside as the drum turns. There is nothing in the dryer and it still makes the noise. What should I check and in what order.Thanks, Jim
For model number DBXR453ET5WW



Hi Jim, Thank you for the question. You can check the belt to make sure it is not wore out and and preventing the drum to turn as it should.You can also check the Rear Drum Bearing for wear. Make sure the appliance is getting proper air flow. Clean the Lint Trap Duct Assembly and the Air Vents. You can use a Multi Meter to test the High Limit Thermostat and the Bias Thermostat as well for proper continuity. Hope this helps!

A question about dryer . Once in awhile durnh a drying cycle the dryer will make a squeaking noise.And sometimes the dryer will take a long time to dry but i found the front seal was broken and not fully there.



Hi Juan,
Thank you for your question.  The squeaking noise you are hearing is likely a worn drum support roller that needs to be replaced.  It is always recommended to replace both of them at the same time.  If your dryer is taking a long time to dry and the front seal I would recommend replacing it as this is likely causing the issue.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!

How many glide slips would come with this? The dryer needs four. Does this purchase buy me four?



Hi Hansel, 

Thank you for your question. These parts are sold individually. Be sure to check your model number and make sure that you need four of these ones and not two of these slides and two of a different kind. Good luck with your repair.

My dryer makes a thumping noise when it is running.
For model number GFDN120ED1WW



Hi Denny,
Thank you for your inquiry.  There are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the drive belt, the idler pulley wheel, the complete duct trap assembly, the idler arm, the bearing retainer and the bearing slides.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!

Drum Bearing Slide - Green (Sold individually) Specifications
This original equipment manufacturer Drum Bearing Slide is a plastic, green, easy-to-install part for your dryer. It replaces the dryer's front drum slide to allow for easier movement.  You'll know if this part is an issue if your dryer is unable to tumble properly or is very noisy. Damage can come from regular use. As the slides start to break down it may cause your dryer to make noise or not dry clothes in the usual amount of time. You will need to purchase two for both sides of your dryer. They attach to the outer-most sides of the bearing. The manufacturer recommends replacing both slides at the same time. Take this opportunity to clean out the lint and dust in the dryer, to keep it running smoothly. This is a genuine replacement part that comes directly from the manufacturer. This item is sold individually. The part attaches to the outermost side of the bearing. Although this part is denoted as being "Green" in its title, many users and technicians have noted that its true colour is closer to a dark gray or black.

Great Instructions!
I had never taken my dryer apart before, but it had started sounding like a thunderstorm was happening in my basement every time I ran it and about every other time I used it, one article of clothing became wedged between the frame and the drum as it turned, which resulted in a series of very permanent wrinkles as well as some equally permanent black marks on the item (like a localized, unintentional tie-dye effect).  I searched the internet for information on this issue and I found a YouTube video showing exactly how to disassemble the front of the dryer and replace the drum bearing slides.  PartSelect had created the video and included a link to the parts I needed, so I ordered them.  They arrived quickly and I was able to take the dryer apart to replace them, but when I did, I realized that the plastic piece that supported the slides had worn completely through.  I put the new slides in to keep the dryer going temporarily while I ordered a replacement bearing support, and once I put that in, the dryer was working like new again (no more thunderstorm noises and no clothing sacrifices).  I was very happy with the parts I got from PartSelect and also with their detailed, easy-to-follow instructions on YouTube.  I would definitely buy from them again!

Very Easy Repair!
I replaced a drum bearing and drum bearing slides on my 20year old GE dryer. One of the drum slides had fallen apart and was sticking out from the broken bearing snagging and ruining clothes. 
Watched the repair video removed the old drum bearing and put in all four suggested drum bearing slides in a minute.
The entire process took me 18 minutes! The part(s) worked great!

Upon receiving the parts, we went to the video repair instructions.  We found these videos to be very well done and very helpful.  It was great being able to pause the video at specific points until we were able to complete that step of the repair.  All of the replacement parts fit correctly and there were no issues.

Excessive Drum Noise While Drying Clothes



The PartSelect company's "how to" repair videos are OUTSTANDING. Thank you! The videos provided a comprehensive overview of what to expect in terms of clothes dryer disassembly, component replacement and reassembly. The videos were invaluable tutorials for prior-to-disassembly work.I ordered all the following parts which I fel
                            ... Read more
t were likely excessively worn--white and green bearing slides (two of each required), rear drum bearing kit, drive belt, and idler pulley wheel--to address the noisiness issue.For your consideration: Since our dryer is 12 years old and would be disassembled anyway, I decided to order a new dryer drum belt and idler pulley, to replace these two constant-use items as preventive maintenance.Two notes.One: When replacing the dryer drum bearing parts, you need a T25 torx bit to loosen and remove the three torx-head screws. But using my T25 torx bit-head-style screwdriver, it was impossible to loosen them. Fortunately, I had a T25 torx bit, which I could mount in a socket wrench, which DID allow me to loosen those three torx-head screws without damage/breakage. WHEW! Recommend you are similarly prepared!Two: If you purchase the "Rear Drum Bearing Kit," it already comes with the the "Drum Bearing Sleeve" and "Retainer O-Ring" components I thought I would also need--no need to purchase separately. I returned those two items, unopened, for a refund.All together, from dryer disassembly to, component replacement, to a thorough vacuuming/cleaning, to reassembly and an operational check, it took about four hours. The dryer is now nearly noiseless again! Success!I consider myself reasonably good with tools and have a fair amount of electrical and mechanical skill. My wife assisted with extra hands a couple times, too, seriously reducing my frustration level. Depending on your abilities, you'll take more time or less time than the four hours it took me. I'm certain I saved at least a couple hundred dollars by doing this maintenance myself.In summary, the PartSelect person taking my order was knowledgeable and professional, I received my parts two days after ordering, the parts worked perfectly, and the company refunded my two, unopened returned parts promptly. Overall, a terrific experience. I highly recommend them to any capable do-it-yourselfer.Thanks, PartSelect!

Dryer was making a loud noise when running.



I am a 55 year old woman who likes to repair household items. I followed You Tube instructions and did it all by myself.  A few screws to get the top off and a two more to remove the front piece.  Trap duct assembly was cracked and falling apart.  Pulling off the old was fairly easy.  I watched the You Tube instructions on my Ipad so I co

uld rewind and watch as I did it.  The hardest part was I dropped one of the screws when placing the front of the dryer back on and had to find another one that was the same size.  Luckily I have lots of old screws in my tool box,  If you like to do small simple repairs to save some money this is an easy one.

Looking to replace the green and the white glides but forget which went where, can you give me rough positioning?



Hi Peter, you can position the white bearing slides at approximately 9 and 3 o’clock (across from each other). The green bearing slides can be placed at approximately 1 and 11 o’clock. I hope this helps you visualize it better!

how many of these do I need to order to replace the green drum slides and how many come in a package



Hi Rachel, the drum slides come in one per package, so you will need to order two of each. For the green drum slides you can order part number WE1M1067, and for the white you can order part number WE1M504. Although only your green drum slides need replacing at the moment, we strongly advise replacing both the green and the white (upper and lower) together for an even wear. Please let us know if you have any further questions.

Drum bearing slides: What is the difference between the Green, and the white drum bearing slides?
For model number DX4500EE1WW



Hi Kerry,
Thank you for your inquiry.  The green slides go on the inner most slots on the front bearing while the white glides go on the outer most sides of the front bearing.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!

Hello, my front bearing and bearing slides are completely worn out. There is only one bearing slide left on the right side and it's white. There are white and Green slides available for this model. What do i order, all white? What's the difference? Thanks, gary
For model number DBSR463GG0WW



Hi Gary, Thank you for the question. You will need to order two white and two green slides. Each side of the front drum bearing will need a white and green slide. Hope this helps!

There is a squeaking noise coming from my dryer. The top two slides look like they’ve seen better days. What do I need to order to fix my dyer?



Hello Andrea, to fix the squeaking noise you will need two upper bearing slides found here (green) WE1M1067, and two lower bearing slides found here (white) WE1M504. We recommend replacing all of them at the same time for an even wear. Best of luck with this repair!

There are 4 drum bearing slides 2 white 2 Green can i replace them with either all Green or white??
For model number DVLR223EE2WW



Hello Paul, thank you for your question. No, unfortunately you would have to have 2 white and 2 green. They are a bit different and the manufacturer recommends ordering 2 of each. I hope this helps!

I need to replace the drum bearing slides on me GE dryer (2 Green and 2 white). The two installation videos show the Green ones go one lower or outside slots and the white ones go on the upper or inside slots. There are a couple of q&a's that say just the opposite. Which is correct?
For model number DWSR473EV1WW



Hello Denis, thank you for your question. It is recommended to follow the instructions in the videos that we have provided for both the white and green slides. Good luck with your repair!

I had a service technician come look at my dryer because it was really loud. She replaced the two upper slides with dark ones (I can't say they're exactly Green, more kind of black ish). She didn't replace the white ones, and she said the larger plastic front drum bearing was no longer available anywhere, and I should plan on buying a new dryer soon. Funny thing, I'm looking at it on your website! Do I need to replace the slides that she installed, or can I take them off and put them onto a new bearing, along with a set of new white ones? Also, can I re use the felt pieces or can they be ordered? Thank you!
For model number pwsr483ga1ww



Hello Karen, Thank you for the question. The "Green" Slide, Part #: PS6447706 is more of a black in color. You would be able to reuse then on the New Front Tub Bearing, Part #: PS960316. We also recommend replacing the White Slides, Part #: PS755842. We hope this helps!

How do I get the front bearing to clip on dryer?
For model number DWSR483GB3CC



Hi Larry,
Thank you for your question.  There is a video listed with the front bearing on our website that you can reference on how to install it.  The dryer in the video may not show exactly like the one you have, but it will give you a general idea on how to install the part.  Here is a link to the part where you will find the video, https://www.partselect.com/PS960316-GE-WE3M26-Front-Drum-Bearing.htm?SourceCode=4&SearchTerm=DWSR483GB3CC&ModelNum=DWSR483GB3CC.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!
